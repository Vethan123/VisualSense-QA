# VisualSense QA

VisualSense QA is a visual question answering (VQA) application built using Streamlit and ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer). It allows users to ask questions about images, and the model provides answers based on the content of the images.

## Features

- **Visual Question Answering (VQA):** Users can upload images and ask questions about them. The model processes the image and generates answers to the questions asked.
- **Interactive Interface:** The Streamlit interface provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for interacting with the VQA model.
- **ViLT Integration:** ViLT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) powers the VQA model, allowing it to understand both visual and textual inputs.
